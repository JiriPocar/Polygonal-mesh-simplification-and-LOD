# Level of detail in huge scenes

## Requirements

- Vulkan SDK [found here](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home). Make sure to restart Visual Studio after the installation.
- *(optional)* Python and ```matplotlib``` for performance statistics visualization

# Since last meeting
- Theoretical part of the thesis
	- Many re-iterations of existing chapters (Nanite, model repr., Vulkan chapter, ..)
	- Some reiterations left (simpl. methods, )
	- Completed remaining chapters (CLOD, View-dependent LOD, additional techniques, libraries)
	- Structure changes in chapters (chronology)
	- Formal side of the thesis improved (figures, equations, pointers to these)
- Implementation part of the thesis
	- Looked for inspiration in existing theses
	- Format of the design and implementation chapters to be decided
		- Added Spiral app design
- Application
	- Added VMA (Spiral CPU-compute boost, tweaking desired comparison)
		- Some thorough testing was done here, to assure that the performance boost is not a fluke
	- Refactored spaghetti ```main``` codes
	- Added base python scripts for performance statistics visualization
	- SPIRAL APP
		- Several UI and QoL Spiral app improvements (wireframe mode in particular)
	- SIMPLIFICATOR APP 
		- Completed twin tracking for QEM simplification
		- Completed Vertex Decimation simplification
		- Several UI improvements in the simplificator app
- Other
	- Visited a lecture about computer graphics in KCD2
		- 50 000 up to 100 000 triangles per character
		- up to 10 milion triangles for a whole scene
		- use of imposters (billboards)
		- polygonal meshes with rasterization pipeline
		- very specific profiler for frame times
	- Found out I was stuck on very damaged models
		- Model with X meshes spread across the whole model 
		- Only use apropriate models (fix in Blender) 

# Known issues

- [FIXED] On first run, the application might crash when loading a model. Restarting the application resolves the issue.
- Spiral app tends to be 'tweaking' until you reset the animation time
- Simplificator doesn't handle non-manifold meshes well, though is still functional.
